# **Exercise on target tracking**

## Task objective: double tracking
-   The idea of this home exercise is to create an algorithm that allows the continuous tracking after the person - "target" - by a couple of agents
-   Given a DSM (Digital Surface Model) building's map - 100 [m] x 100 [m] matrix ????
-   Given the "target" maximum speed as 1 meter/second in a not known in advance route. The "target movement is limited only to "ground" level
-   Given the "agents" speed as 2 meters/second, and are only allowed to be as close as 10 meters (no less than this) from the "target". The "agents" movement is also limited to "ground" level
-   The home exercise objective is to create an algorithm that once in a second, gives us the "target" and "agents" position given the limitations above, and issues instructions to the "agents" next movement in order that at least one of the "agents" could have "eye-contact" as much as possible with the "target"

## Clarifications from Yair email (2021-02-21)
-   Work with the DSM with the size 'as is' 351x201 pixels 
-   One pixel equals to one meter
-   The target is supposed to have constant rate (1 meter/second) and could NOT stop
-   The agent could also stop or up to 2 meters/second (0 meters/second, 1 meter/second, 2 meters/second)
-   Starting points for the target and agents could be in every place but NOT in a "obstacle" level (NOT "ground" level)
-   The agents will have LOS with the "target" in the first simulation cycle

# Line of sight (LOS)
## Show line of sight between the "follower" and the "target" if the LOS exists



```

##    Help tools for the solution
###       Line of sight (LOS) map
-   Map for every pixel at "ground" level, all the pixels that are inside the LOS
-   Take a few locations in the DSM and show the results in it

##    Working with "only" one agent
-   Write a function that will return the progress command to the agent given his and the "target" current locations: __CalculateNextLocation(TargetCurrentLocation, FollowerCurrentLocation)__
-   Progress command will take in account the potential next location of both the "target" and the "agent" so that will have LOS between "agent" and "target" as much as possible time

```{r}



CalculateNextLocation = function(TargetCurrentLocation, AgentCurrentLocation)
{
  return (AgentNextLocation)
}

```


##    Working with a couple of agents - Central calculation
-   Like in the previous section, but the function should give guidance to both agent: __CalculateNextLocation2(TargetCurrentLocation, AgentCurrentLocation)__
-   It is desirable that there will be some kind of coordination between both commands so that one agent will complement the other

##    Working with a couple of agents - Distributed calculation
-   Write a function that will return the progress command to a __single__ agent given his, the second agent and the "target" current locations: __CalculateNextLocation3(TargetCurrentLocation, OtherAgentCurrentLocation, AgentCurrentLocation)__
-   The functions (for each agent) are not related between them
-   The functions will give guidance every 2 seconds, once the function will work with agent1, and the next second will work with agent2, therefore the function(s) won't work with the same input
-   It is desirable that there will be some kind of coordination between both commands so that one agent will complement the other

#   Solution

##    1.1) Display the DSM file in Python / Matlab (in this case as .png file)
```{r}
# view raster attributes
DsmTestRaster   <- raster("/home/pablo/Documents/Software Engineering/AI home exercise/Solution/output/1_2 2_DsmOriginalFile Target.tif")
plot(DsmTestRaster)
```


##    1.2.2) Display "target" path progress over time on map

##    Bonus) Display "agent alone" path progress over time on map (to show different A* configuration)

##    2.2) Take a number of DSM locations and display the LOS between them

##   Algorithm for lonely agent following target
-   Build a list of possible NEXT locations both for agent and target with SwissArmyKnife.PossibleMovements() given as input parameters: type of movement of person (1 meter constant, up to two meters, etc), current location and DSM map info, and receiving as output the list of possible NEXT movements

-   Filter from this list only the locations that have LOS between agent and target and also that will be at a minimum distance of the ALLOWED distance (10 meters in this case) with SwissArmyKnife.PossibleLineOfSightLocations() given as input parameters: list of possible NEXT movements from both agent and target, DSM map info, and minimum ALLOWED distance between both agent and target. The output received from this function is a new list having all the possible NEXT movements for agent, that will have LOS with target caring for the minimum allowed distance

-   Rank the last list by minimum and maximum distance from agent to target, quantity of potential LOS with target, and distance to obstacle with the following functions: SwissArmyKnife.Ranking(). The idea of ranking, is that for all the potential movements, there will be a minimum and maximum (range) for each one of these variables. And therefore we will rank from 0% to 100%, according to where specific element is in the range of the possible NEXT movements.

-   Once ranked these variables, we could use another function: SwissArmyKnife.RankingOrder() that will give a specific relative "weight" for each one of these variables:
  minimum distance from agent to target
  maximum distance from agent to target
  quantity of possible LOS situations
  minimum distance to obstacle
  
-   This function will order this list according to our requirements
-   After a few verifications, it has been seen, that the distance to obstacle should be with high relative weight, but once the distance between target and agent is more than 20, then the weigth should fall more in the minimum distance to target (in order for the agent to reduce the distance)

-   In case of LOS loss, we need to have the last target position seen (as the "target" position), modify temporarily the possibility to stay in place for the agent, so it could move towards the last seen position. Once there is again LOS,  we need to bring back the regular configuration, and set the target position as the real target position

##    3)	Working with two agents (centralized control)

FPS = 10


```{r}
# Set the working directory
setwd ("/home/pablo/Documents/Software Engineering/AI home exercise/Solution/output")
# Import the two agents with centralized control data-frame, importing the header and classifying non available data
twoAgentsWithCentralizedControl.data  = read.csv(file = "twoAgentsWithCentralCalculation.csv", header = TRUE, na.strings = "NaN")
# Display table with the required information
#kable(twoAgentsWithCentralizedControl.data, 
#      label = "Two agents following target (with central control)")
