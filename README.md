AI Home Exercise

The idea of this home exercise is to create an algorithm that allows the continuous tracking after the person - “target” - by a couple of agents 
Given a DSM (Digital Surface Model) building’s map - 100 [m] x 100 [m] matrix ???? 
Given the “target” maximum speed as 1 meter/second in a not known in advance route. 
The “target movement is limited only to”ground" level Given the “agents” speed as 2 meters/second, 
and are only allowed to be as close as 10 meters (no less than this) from the “target”. 
The “agents” movement is also limited to “ground” level The home exercise objective is to create an algorithm that once in a second, 
gives us the “target” and “agents” position given the limitations above, 
and issues instructions to the “agents” next movement in order that at least one of the “agents” could have “eye-contact” as much as possible with the “target”
